In this project I finally got to make my first full webpage with just a screenshot of how it should look like and some font information.

Things that I learned were how to effectively make containers and nest elements inside them to make them fit. I also learned how to effectively apply widths and heights to containers. My flex exercises really helped me prepare for this moment, just like the CSS exercises.

What I'm most proud of is my HTML groundwork, which I got done quickly and almost completely like the final product on my first try. I'm also proud of how I tried to make the code as clear to read as possible, both HTML and CSS. I hope others find this to be the case too.

Things that I would like to improve is how to write CSS more effeciently and how to manage containers in a more effective way so they don't clutter. Indentations help a lot to make code more readable, but learning how to minimize your code is something I would love to learn.
